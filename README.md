Mashable.com publishes news articles which is read by people around the globe. Our data set is a second-hand data retrieved from UCI Machine Learning repository website. This dataset encapsulates a varied set of features about articles published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) over a period of two years. This multivariate dataset has 39797 instances and covers 61 attributes, including 58 predictive attributes, 2 non predictive and 1 goal (Target) field. The two non-predictive attributes (URL and time delta) of the dataset does not affect the outcomes of analysis. The goal of our project is to predict the popularity (no. of shares) of articles published by Mashable in Social networks.


Our analysis includes the below points:
•	We explored the dataset and started with data cleaning techniques such as eliminating Missing values, identifying outliers and removing it and filter analysis.
•	We also worked on Data Transformation techniques such as Dimensionality reduction of variables i.e. few attributes are merged into single attribute while retaining the data.
•	Used techniques like clustering in order to classify the data and predict the outcome.
•	Classified the target variable using Binning methods to determine the category of output variable.
•	Techniques such as decision tree, linear regression analysis and neural networks were used in order to predict the number of shares of the news article.
•	Results showed Neural Networks performed better with 66% accuracy and 21.27% average squared error.
